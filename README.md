# code-samples

01. C++ DungeonCrawler - First big project completed in C++, in the first class I completed in the language. We were to use 
containers to make a "maze" of sorts, where you could pick up and "item" and drop it in another "room", leave the room, and come
back to find the item.


02. C++ Lab 1 - Assignment to make vector class.


03. C++ Lab 2 - Assigment to make linked list class


04. C++ Tests - Various example questions given to us before the final paper exam, as practice before taking it (one of which 
was included on the test).


05. C# Racetrack Creator - Code for building a racetrack in Unity using assets in-game for a Mario Kart clone for a client.


06. C# Random Scripts - Some code that was used for a design analysis project for a puzzle-type game (NO COMMENTS inside code as 
the code was secondary to the project's grade, and had a time-limit)
