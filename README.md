# code-samples

01. C++ DungeonCrawler - First big project completed in C++, in the first class I completed in the language. We were to use 
containers to make a "maze" of sorts, where you could pick up and "item" and drop it in another "room", leave the room, and come
back to find the item.


02. C++ Lab 1 - Assignment to make vector class.


03. C++ Lab 2 - Assigment to make linked list class


04. C++ Tests - Various example questions given to us before the final paper exam, as practice before taking it (one of which 
was included on the test).


05. C++ AudioGenerator - NOT ALL MY CODE. My code is in SampleGenerators.cpp in the form of the Sint16 Get"X"Sample, where
we were to make our own sound waves. My code in main.cpp is labeled //My song - Kyle Bernelle, which is mainly 'if' statements 
to signal different keystroke commands and then the "song" I created using my own wave samples.


06. C# Racetrack Creator - Code for building a racetrack in Unity using assets in-game for a Mario Kart clone for a client.


07. C# Random Scripts - Some code that was used for a design analysis project for a puzzle-type game (NO COMMENTS inside code as 
the code was secondary to the project's grade, and had a time-limit)
